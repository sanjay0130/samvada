Absolutely! Let’s break it step by step, so you can see exactly what each part does. This will also make it easier to adjust in the future.

Step 1: Get the tabid for Leads and Potentials
-- Get tabid of Leads module
SELECT tabid, name FROM vtiger_tab WHERE name = 'Leads';

-- Get tabid of Potentials module
SELECT tabid, name FROM vtiger_tab WHERE name = 'Potentials';


Purpose:
Vtiger stores module IDs (tabid) in vtiger_tab. We need these to find the correct fields in the next steps.

Step 2: Get fieldid of the Lead Primary Phone (phone)
SELECT fieldid, fieldname, tabid 
FROM vtiger_field 
WHERE fieldname = 'phone' 
  AND tabid = (SELECT tabid FROM vtiger_tab WHERE name = 'Leads');


Purpose:
Find the unique fieldid of the Lead field you want to copy from.

Step 3: Get fieldid of the Opportunity (Potential) Mobile Phone (cf_751)
SELECT fieldid, fieldname, tabid 
FROM vtiger_field 
WHERE fieldname = 'cf_751' 
  AND tabid = (SELECT tabid FROM vtiger_tab WHERE name = 'Potentials');


Purpose:
Find the unique fieldid of the Opportunity field you want to prefill.

Step 4: Check existing mapping in vtiger_convertleadmapping
SELECT * 
FROM vtiger_convertleadmapping
WHERE potentialfid = (
    SELECT fieldid 
    FROM vtiger_field 
    WHERE fieldname = 'cf_751' 
      AND tabid = (SELECT tabid FROM vtiger_tab WHERE name = 'Potentials')
);


Purpose:
See if there is already a mapping for cf_751. This helps prevent overwriting accidentally.

Step 5: Update the mapping to use Lead Primary Phone
UPDATE vtiger_convertleadmapping
SET leadfid = (
    SELECT fieldid 
    FROM vtiger_field 
    WHERE fieldname = 'phone' 
      AND tabid = (SELECT tabid FROM vtiger_tab WHERE name = 'Leads')
)
WHERE potentialfid = (
    SELECT fieldid 
    FROM vtiger_field 
    WHERE fieldname = 'cf_751' 
      AND tabid = (SELECT tabid FROM vtiger_tab WHERE name = 'Potentials')
);


Purpose:
Maps the Opportunity field cf_751 to the Lead Primary Phone.

✅ Optional: Verify the update
SELECT * 
FROM vtiger_convertleadmapping
WHERE potentialfid = (
    SELECT fieldid 
    FROM vtiger_field 
    WHERE fieldname = 'cf_751' 
      AND tabid = (SELECT tabid FROM vtiger_tab WHERE name = 'Potentials')
);


Purpose:
Ensure that leadfid is now pointing to the phone field of the Lead module.

Summary of the Steps

Find tabid of both modules.

Get fieldid of the Lead field (phone).

Get fieldid of the Opportunity field (cf_751).

Check if mapping exists in vtiger_convertleadmapping.

Update mapping to point to Lead Primary Phone.

Verify the mapping.
